Space Reactor User Manual

Fuel Type: The Space Reactor uses "tritium", a rare element.

Installation: Use the mounting brackets to securely attach the reactor to the spacecraft's frame. Connect the power cables to the spacecraft's power grid, ensuring correct polarity. Do not connect the reactor to any other power source.

Operation: Ensure that the spacecraft's main systems are powered off. Turn on the reactor by pressing the green button on the control panel. The reactor will take approximately 30 seconds to initiate and a blue light will indicate that it is functioning correctly. The reactor will automatically regulate the amount of fuel required for optimal performance, and the energy generated will be distributed to the spacecraft's power grid.

Maintenance: Inspect the fuel levels and external components for signs of wear regularly. Carrying out any necessary repairs requires the correct training. Wear protective gear when carrying out maintenance.

Safety: Keep the reactor away from flammable materials. Do not modify or repair the reactor without the correct training. If the reactor malfunctions, switch it off immediately and seek professional assistance.
